The widget uses https://openweathermap.org for weather information and you can access after getting your own AppID. After getting it, fill out weather settings in Guna Widget.sublime-settings. The 1st icon means current weather, the 2nd icon means forecast in 3 hours, the 3rd icon means forecast in 6 hours. Normally, it will be updated every half an hour.
